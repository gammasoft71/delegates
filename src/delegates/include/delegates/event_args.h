  /// @remarks This class serves as the base class for all classes that represent event data. For example, the xtd::forms::form_closing_event_args class derives from event_args and is used to hold information when form closin. To create a custom event data class, create a class that derives from the event_args class and provide the properties to store the necessary data. The name of your custom event data class should end with _event_args.
